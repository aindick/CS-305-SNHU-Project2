# CS-305-SNHU-Project2

-- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

-The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company where they help customers with creating financial plans. Artemis Financial wanted me to help them with giving security advice for their platform. They want to protect their users from security threats.

-- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

-I believe, once I found the security vulnerabilities, that I did well with explaining each vulnerability, what it is and solutions to them. It is important to have secure code since hackers can take advantage of the application by taking user data. If the user data is compromised, it is bad for the safety of the customers. Software security adds to a company's wellbeing since no one would want to use an application that has security issues like suceptibility to attacks. Artemis Financial would have no customers if they did not have security for their platform and therefore it would cause the company to fail. 

-- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
